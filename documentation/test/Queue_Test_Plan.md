## Implementation Guidelines

1. Use TypeScript for all tests
2. Follow functional programming principles
3. Use TaskEither for error handling
4. Implement proper cleanup in beforeEach/afterEach
5. Use meaningful test descriptions
6. Group related tests logically
7. Mock external dependencies where appropriate
8. Test both success and failure paths

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass consistently
2. No resource leaks
3. Proper error handling coverage
4. Clear test output
5. Fast test execution
6. Maintainable test code
7. Good documentation
