  - [ ] Test queue draining (drain)
  - [ ] Test queue cleaning (clean)
  - [ ] Test queue obliteration (obliterate)
  - [ ] Test queue pause/resume
  - [ ] Test error handling for all operations

### 2. Scheduler Service Tests

- Core Operations
  - [ ] Test scheduler creation
  - [ ] Test job scheduler creation (upsertJobScheduler)
    - [ ] With interval-based scheduling
    - [ ] With cron pattern scheduling
  - [ ] Test listing job schedulers (getJobSchedulers)
    - [ ] Test pagination
    - [ ] Test sorting (asc/desc)
  - [ ] Test error handling for all operations

### 3. Flow Service Tests

  - [ ] Test flow service creation with connection
  - [ ] Test single flow addition (addFlow)
  - [ ] Test bulk flow addition (addBulkFlows)
  - [ ] Test flow removal (removeFlow)
  - [ ] Test bulk flow removal (removeBulkFlows)
  - [ ] Test getting flow dependencies (getFlowDependencies)
  - [ ] Test getting children values (getChildrenValues)

- Flow Patterns
  - [ ] Test parent-child relationships
  - [ ] Test multi-level flow hierarchies
  - [ ] Test flow with multiple children
  - [ ] Test flow with shared dependencies

### 4. Worker Service Tests

- Core Operations
  - [ ] Test worker creation with configuration
  - [ ] Test concurrency settings
  - [ ] Test worker pause/resume
  - [ ] Test worker closure
  - [ ] Test error handling

## Integration Tests

### 1. Queue-Worker Integration

- [ ] Test job processing flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test concurrent job processing
- [ ] Test job failure handling
- [ ] Test retry mechanisms
- [ ] Test worker recovery after disconnection

### 2. Flow-Queue Integration

- [ ] Test flow job processing order
- [ ] Test parent job completion after children
- [ ] Test flow job failure handling
- [ ] Test flow job recovery

### 3. Scheduler-Queue Integration

- [ ] Test scheduled job execution
- [ ] Test repeatable job patterns
- [ ] Test scheduler-worker coordination
- [ ] Test scheduled job failure handling

## Performance Tests

### 1. Load Testing

- [ ] Test high-volume job processing
- [ ] Test concurrent flow execution
- [ ] Test scheduler performance under load
- [ ] Test worker performance with different concurrency settings

### 2. Reliability Tests

- [ ] Test system behavior under Redis disconnection
- [ ] Test recovery after service restart
- [ ] Test memory usage under sustained load
- [ ] Test data consistency after failures

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- [ ] Dedicated test Redis instance
- [ ] Isolated test queues
- [ ] Clean environment between tests
- [ ] Proper logging configuration

### 2. Test Data

- [ ] Create test job templates
- [ ] Create test flow templates
- [ ] Create test scheduler patterns
- [ ] Define test scenarios for each service

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Use TypeScript for all tests
2. Follow functional programming principles
3. Use TaskEither for error handling
4. Implement proper cleanup in beforeEach/afterEach
5. Use meaningful test descriptions
6. Group related tests logically
7. Mock external dependencies where appropriate
8. Test both success and failure paths

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass consistently
2. No resource leaks
3. Proper error handling coverage
4. Clear test output
5. Fast test execution
6. Maintainable test code
7. Good documentation
