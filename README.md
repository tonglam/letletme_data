# Overall

Letletme_data fetches data from the Fantasy Premier League servers, cleans and transforms the data, and then stores it in MongoDB and Redis, providing APIs for querying data.

And, to be honest, it's the first time I've used the Functional Programming (FP) paradigm to design an application. Transitioning from a long-time OOP designer to an FP one isn't easy. Using TypeScript in such an application requires a lot of advanced TS knowledge, especially with generic types, which can make design more difficult. 

However, once all the functions are set, it becomes really easy to use and maintain, and it feels graceful and elegant.

# Functional Programming

This project focuses on fetching, transforming, and storing data, and functional programming is well-suited for the task.
