# Domain Layer Implementation Guide

## Overview

The domain layer represents the core business logic of our FPL data service. Following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, each domain is self-contained and implements pure business logic without external dependencies.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Domain-Driven Design Choice

The choice of DDD stems from the inherent complexity of FPL data management:

1. **Complex Domain Logic**

   - Intricate business rules around game weeks, player values, and team management
   - DDD helps model these complexities explicitly
   - Makes the system more maintainable and adaptable to changes

2. **Natural Domain Boundaries**

   - FPL naturally divides into distinct domains (events, teams, players, entries)
   - Each domain has its own lifecycle and rules
   - DDD's bounded contexts map perfectly to these divisions

3. **Data Evolution Management**
   - FPL data constantly evolves throughout the season
   - Domain models help manage this evolution
   - Maintains data consistency and historical tracking

### Functional Programming Integration

FP principles complement the DDD approach by providing:

1. **Immutability**

   - All domain models are immutable
   - Prevents unexpected state changes
   - Makes the system more predictable

2. **Pure Functions**

   - Business logic implemented as pure functions
   - Easier to test and maintain
   - Clear reasoning about behavior

3. **Type Safety**
   - Strong typing with FP concepts
   - Option for nullable values
   - Either for error handling

## Domain Structure

Each domain follows a consistent four-file structure:

### 1. Types (types.ts)

- Domain models and interfaces
- Value objects
- Operation types
- Result types
- Validation schemas

### 2. Operations (operations.ts)

- Pure business logic
- Validation rules
- Transformation functions
- Domain-specific calculations
- State transitions

### 3. Queries (queries.ts)

- Read operations
- Data filtering
- Search functionality
- Aggregations
- View models

### 4. Repository (repository.ts)

- Data persistence
- Data retrieval
- Transaction handling
- Cache coordination
- Data mapping

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Domain Isolation

- Self-contained domains
- Clear dependencies
- Explicit interfaces
- No cross-domain knowledge

### 2. Type Safety

- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Comprehensive type definitions
- No type assertions
- Union types for state

### 3. Error Handling

- Domain-specific errors
- Either for operation results
- Meaningful error messages
- Error recovery patterns

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

- Pure operations
- Business rules
- Error handling
- Type safety

### 2. Integration Tests

- Repository operations
- Cache integration
- Database operations
- API integration

### 3. Property Tests

- Business rules
- Edge cases
- State transitions
- Invariants

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization

- Consistent structure
- Clear naming
- Proper documentation
- Separation of concerns

### 2. Performance

- Efficient algorithms
- Appropriate data structures
- Caching strategy
- Query optimization

### 3. Maintainability

- Clear documentation
- Consistent patterns
- Proper logging
- Test coverage
